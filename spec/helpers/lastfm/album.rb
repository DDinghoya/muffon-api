Working with producer Nicolas Vernhes, Tatum stated: “The biggest thing was just having a producer, having somebody extremely knowledgeable to work with. I mean, obviously I had a lot of nice equipment at my disposal for the first time, too ... But I never wanted to use any of that to pursue a wholly different sound to the first album; it was just nice to have somebody to bounce ideas off, to help me tweak things.” \"Shadow,\" the first song from Nocturne to be released, features a string section, something Tatum \"never\" could have done without a studio environment", :title=>"Nocturne"}}
