Working with producer Nicolas Vernhes, Tatum stated: “The biggest thing was just having a producer, having somebody extremely knowledgeable to work with. I mean, obviously I had a lot of nice equipment at my disposal for the first time, too ... But I never wanted to use any of that to pursue a wholly different sound to the first album; it was just nice to have somebody to bounce ideas off, to help me tweak things.” \"Shadow,\" the first song from Nocturne to be released, features a string section, something Tatum \"never\" could have done without a studio environment", :listeners_count=>247670, :mbid=>"172124dd-72da-4822-9945-e81b262ca7b3", :plays_count=>6178839, :tags=>["2012", "dream pop", "best of 2012", "indie", "favorite albums"], :title=>"Nocturne", :tracks=>[{:length=>258, :title=>"Shadow"}, {:length=>185, :title=>"Midnight Song"}, {:length=>318, :title=>"Nocturne"}, {:length=>260, :title=>"Through the Grass"}, {:length=>200, :title=>"Only Heather"}, {:length=>218, :title=>"This Chain Won’t Break"}, {:length=>209, :title=>"Disappear Always"}, {:length=>330, :title=>"Paradise"}, {:length=>231, :title=>"Counting Days"}, {:length=>207, :title=>"The Blue Dress"}, {:length=>235, :title=>"Rheya"}]}}
