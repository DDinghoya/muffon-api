          {:track=>{:description=>"\"Hounds of Love\" is a song written, produced and performed by British singer Kate Bush. It is the title track and the third single released from her number one 1985 album Hounds of Love. The single was released on 24 February 1986, and reached number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. \n\nThis is about the fear that rules all of us in one way or another, in particular the fear of love. The hounds of love that are hunting you is imagery for love itself as something to be feared, to run away from lest it catches you and rips you up. At the same time, it says that perhaps the hounds are friendly and one should not fear love (\"I've always been a coward, and never know what's good for me\"). (source songfacts).\n\nThe song was inspired in part by an old black-and-white movie which was sort of a cult classic in Kate's family titled Night Of The Demon. The movie was about demons who hid waiting in trees - the song's opening line (in a male voice) \"It's coming! It's in the trees!\" is taken directly from the movie.\n\nIn October 2004, Q magazine placed this song at No.21 in its list of the 50 greatest British songs of all-time. \n\nBritish band The Futureheads covered the song in 2005, scoring a UK top 10 hit with it."}}
