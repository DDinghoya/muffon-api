        pop sound, their sound a collage of soft,  almost indecipherable vocals and
        languid soundscapes. A.R. Kane were the first band to explicitly describe
        their music as ''dream pop'' and once claimed that \"a lot of the time we''re
        trying to transform dream imagery into sounds.\" Which echoes My Bloody Valentine
        (who are a premier Dream Pop group who had a huge influence on ''shoegazers''
        like Slowdive and Lush) approach to recording music while in a state between
        sleep and wakefulness (hypnagogic).\n\n\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/dream+pop\">Read
