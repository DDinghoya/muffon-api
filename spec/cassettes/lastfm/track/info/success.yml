        imagery for love itself as something to be feared, to run away from lest it
        catches you and rips you up. At the same time, it says that perhaps the hounds
        are friendly and one should not fear love (\"I''ve always been a coward, and
        never know what''s good for me\"). (source songfacts).\n\nThe song was inspired
        in part by an old black-and-white movie which was sort of a cult classic in
        Kate''s family titled Night Of The Demon. The movie was about demons who hid
        waiting in trees - the song''s opening line (in a male voice) \"It''s coming!
        It''s in the trees!\" is taken directly from the movie.\n\nIn October 2004,
        Q magazine placed this song at No.21 in its list of the 50 greatest British
        songs of all-time. \n\nBritish band The Futureheads covered the song in 2005,
        scoring a UK top 10 hit with it.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/_/Hounds+of+Love\">Read
